This is an exprimental project to test various possible large-scale changes
to Crossroads I/O project.

Namely, following changes are being tested:

1. Different threading model. The idea is to do all the processing in the
   application threads and only offload it to a worker thread when
   the synchronous operation would block (IOCP-style).

2. The code is MIT-licensed (as opposed to LGPL) to test how hard would it be
   to change the licensing.

3. It's written in C rather than C++. The idea is to find out how much would
   this simplify the codebase. Removing the dependency on libstdc++ is an
   interesting side effect.

4. Build system is CMake rather than autotools. CMake is easier to use than
   autotools and have an advantage of working on Windows, which would remove
   the need for maintaining two separate build systems. This project should
   test whether CMake is an viable option.
